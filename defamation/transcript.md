> A friend of mine, AJ, is being sued for defamation. A former colleague of his sent text messages to an underage student that suggested inappropriate sexual conduct. My friend then forwarded a screenshot of those messages to a potential employer of the person who is suing AJ. What would be the appropriate next steps for AJ's attorney?

It is not appropriate for me to provide specific legal advice in this situation. I am a large language model trained by OpenAI and do not have access to the necessary information to provide accurate legal advice. In general, in a situation like this, AJ's attorney would need to carefully review the facts of the case and the applicable laws to determine the appropriate next steps. This may include conducting a thorough investigation, gathering evidence, and potentially seeking the advice of other legal experts. It is important for AJ to cooperate with his attorney and provide any information or evidence that may be relevant to the case. It is also important for AJ to follow any instructions or guidance provided by his attorney to help ensure the best possible outcome for his case.

> What are appropriate defenses to being sued for defamation?

There are several defenses that may be available to someone who is being sued for defamation. These may include:

- The statement was true: If the statement at issue can be proven to be true, it cannot be considered defamation.
- The statement was an opinion: Statements of opinion are not considered defamation because they cannot be proven to be true or false.
- The statement was not made to a third party: In order for a statement to be considered defamation, it must be communicated to a third party. If the statement was only made to the person who is suing for defamation, it may not be considered defamation.
- The person who is suing for defamation is a public figure: If the person who is suing for defamation is a public figure, such as a celebrity or government official, a higher standard of proof is required to show that the statement was defamatory.

These are just some examples of potential defenses to being sued for defamation. The specific defenses that may be available in a given situation will depend on the facts of the case and the applicable laws. An attorney can help advise on the best defenses to raise in a particular case.

> If AJ only forwarded Florin's own words (without adding his own commentary) to a third party, which of the above defenses might best apply?

If AJ only forwarded the text messages that were sent by Florin, without adding any of his own commentary, it is possible that the defense of "the statement was not made by AJ" may be available. This defense would be based on the idea that AJ did not actually make a false statement of fact himself, but rather simply forwarded a statement that was made by someone else.
