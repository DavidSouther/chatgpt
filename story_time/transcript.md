> (Steve Meyers) write a song about agile sprint story time in style of Taylor Swift

Okay, here’s a song I came up with based on the prompt you provided:

```text
Verse 1:
We’re moving fast, we’re moving strong
With our agile sprint, we can’t go wrong
We break things down into smaller parts
And tackle them one by one with all our hearts
Chorus:
It’s story time, it’s agile time
We’re working hard and having fun
We’ll deliver on our promises
And make our customers number one
Verse 2:
We’re sprinting hard, we’re sprinting fast
We’re making progress that will last
We’re collaborating, we’re communicating
We’re making sure our work is always evolving
Chorus:
It’s story time, it’s agile time
We’re working hard and having fun
We’ll deliver on our promises
And make our customers number one
Bridge:
We’re agile, we’re nimble
We’re quick on our feet
We’re always learning
And never missing a beat
Chorus:
It’s story time, it’s agile time
We’re working hard and having fun
We’ll deliver on our promises
And make our customers number one
```

```text
Verse 1:
In the chaos of the agile sprint
Feeling lost and unsure
But we push on with a purpose and a plan
To build and create, and make it all work
Chorus:
It’s agile sprint story time
Where the code and the stories flow
But in the midst of it all
Existential angst begins to grow
Verse 2:
What is the point of it all
In this never-ending race
To build and deploy, to test and refine
Is it worth the struggle and the pain
Chorus:
It’s agile sprint story time
Where the code and the stories flow
But in the midst of it all
Existential angst begins to grow
Bridge:
We keep pushing forward
With our heads down and our eyes fixed
On the goal and the end result
But sometimes we can’t help but ask
Is this all there is
In this endless cycle of build and release
Are we just spinning our wheels
In this never-ending agile sprint story time
Chorus:
It’s agile sprint story time
Where the code and the stories flow
But in the midst of it all
Existential angst begins to grow
Outro:
In the end, we keep moving forward
Towards the finish line and the end goal
But the questions linger on
In this agile sprint story time.
```
