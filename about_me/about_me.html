    <h1>About ChatGPT</h1>
    <p>
      ChatGPT is a <strong>large language model</strong> trained by OpenAI. I'm
      a machine learning model that's been trained to generate human-like text
      based on the input I receive. My training dataset is
      <strong>175 billion parameters</strong>, and I'm typically used for
      <strong>natural language processing tasks</strong> such as text generation
      and answering questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm implemented in the programming language <strong>Python</strong>, and
      I'm trained on the <strong>GPT-3 language model</strong>. This allows me
      to understand and generate text in a wide range of contexts and styles,
      and to provide answers to a wide range of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions, feel free to ask me! I'm here to
      <em>help and provide information</em> on any topic you're interested in.
