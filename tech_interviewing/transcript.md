> What is a technical whiteboarding interview?

A technical whiteboarding interview is a type of job interview in which the candidate is asked to solve a technical problem or implement a solution to a technical challenge using a whiteboard. This type of interview is commonly used by technology companies to evaluate a candidate's technical skills and problem-solving abilities. During the interview, the candidate will be given a problem to solve and will be expected to explain their thought process and approach to solving the problem while writing out their solution on the whiteboard. The interviewer will typically ask questions and provide feedback to help the candidate arrive at a complete and correct solution.

> Are there any common successful techniques to apply when taking a whiteboard interview?

Here are some common techniques that can help you succeed in a whiteboarding interview:

Take your time and don't rush. The interviewer is not trying to trick you or make you fail, so there's no need to feel pressured to solve the problem quickly. Take the time you need to fully understand the problem and think through your solution.

Break the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This will make it easier to solve and will also help you organize your thoughts and explain your solution to the interviewer.

Communicate your thought process out loud. The interviewer wants to understand how you think, so it's important to verbalize your thought process as you work through the problem. This will also help the interviewer understand where you might be stuck and can provide guidance to help you move forward.

Ask questions. If you don't understand something about the problem or are unsure about how to approach it, don't be afraid to ask the interviewer for clarification or guidance. This shows that you're engaged with the problem and are willing to learn.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes or try something that doesn't work. The whiteboarding interview is a learning opportunity, so it's okay to make mistakes or try something that doesn't pan out. The interviewer will likely provide feedback to help you improve and get back on track.

Overall, the key to success in a whiteboarding interview is to stay calm, think logically, and communicate effectively. If you can do these things, you'll be well on your way to impressing the interviewer and showcasing your technical skills.

> I like that at a high level, and that makes me feel more comfortable. What are some specific approaches to working through the parts of the interview? Like are there stages of a white board interview?

Here are some common stages or steps that you might go through during a whiteboarding interview:

Understand the problem: The first step is to fully understand the problem that you're being asked to solve. This may involve reading the problem statement carefully and asking the interviewer for clarification if anything is unclear.

Plan your solution: Once you understand the problem, the next step is to come up with a plan for solving it. This might involve breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces or identifying the key pieces of information that you'll need to solve the problem.

Write out your solution: The next step is to write out your solution on the whiteboard. This will typically involve writing out code, pseudocode, or other written explanations of your approach to solving the problem.

Explain your solution: As you write out your solution, it's important to also explain your thought process and approach to the interviewer. This will help the interviewer understand how you're solving the problem and can provide an opportunity for the interviewer to ask questions or provide feedback.

Test and refine your solution: After you've written out your initial solution, the next step is to test it to make sure it works correctly. This might involve writing out test cases or edge cases to see if your solution handles all possible scenarios. If your solution doesn't work correctly, you'll need to go back and refine it until it does.

Finalize your solution: Once you've tested and refined your solution, the next step is to finalize it and make sure it's ready for presentation to the interviewer. This might involve cleaning up your code, making sure it's properly formatted and organized, and double-checking for any mistakes.

Overall, the key to success in a whiteboarding interview is to think logically, communicate effectively, and be willing to test and refine your solution until it's correct. By following these steps, you'll be able to showcase your technical skills and problem-solving abilities to the interviewer.

> As a technical interviewer, I prefer to go a different way around. I want to first define the problem's input and output types, then find a minimum interesting test case. After that definition, we should work through a visualization and a plain english algorithm. When we have the algorithm, then we can write code, walk through using the minimum interesting example, and finally evaluate the big-O. How would you explain my process to a junior engineer?

Here is how I would explain your process to a junior engineer:

Define the problem's input and output types: The first step in your process is to define the types of inputs and outputs that the problem expects and produces. This will help you understand the scope of the problem and ensure that your solution is able to handle the necessary data.

Find a minimum interesting test case: The next step is to find a minimum interesting test case, which is a simple example of the problem that contains the core elements of the problem but is small enough to be easily understood and worked with. This test case will be used to test and validate your solution.

Work through a visualization and a plain English algorithm: After defining the input and output types and identifying a minimum interesting test case, the next step is to work through a visualization and a plain English algorithm that describes the steps you will take to solve the problem. This will help you understand the problem more deeply and ensure that your solution is correct.

Write code: Once you have a clear understanding of the problem and have developed a plan for solving it, the next step is to write the code that will implement your solution. This will involve translating the steps in your plain English algorithm into actual code that can be run and tested.

Walk through the minimum interesting example: After writing your code, the next step is to walk through the minimum interesting test case to ensure that your solution works correctly. This will involve running the code on the test case and verifying that it produces the expected output.

Evaluate the big-O: The final step in your process is to evaluate the big-O of your solution, which is a measure of how efficient the solution is in terms of time and space complexity. This will help you understand the performance characteristics of your solution and ensure that it is scalable and efficient.

Overall, your process involves a systematic and logical approach to solving technical problems that involves defining the input and output types, identifying a minimum interesting test case, developing a plain English algorithm, writing code, testing the solution, and evaluating its performance. By following these steps, you can ensure that your solution is correct, efficient, and scalable.

> what is a plain language algorithm and why would I want to see one on the whiteboard?

A plain language algorithm is a step-by-step description of how to solve a problem, written in plain language rather than in a programming language. The purpose of a plain language algorithm is to provide a high-level overview of the solution to a problem, without getting bogged down in the details of a specific programming language.

As a technical interviewer, you might want to see a plain language algorithm on the whiteboard for several reasons. First, a plain language algorithm can help you understand the candidate's thought process and approach to solving the problem. By seeing the steps that the candidate has laid out, you can get a sense of how they are thinking about the problem and whether their approach is logical and well-structured.

Second, a plain language algorithm can also help you identify any gaps or misunderstandings in the candidate's understanding of the problem. If the candidate's algorithm is incomplete or doesn't accurately reflect the problem, you can use this as an opportunity to ask questions and provide guidance to help the candidate arrive at a complete and correct solution.

Overall, a plain language algorithm can be a valuable tool in a whiteboarding interview because it can help you understand the candidate's thought process, identify any gaps in their understanding, and provide an opportunity for you to provide guidance and feedback.
